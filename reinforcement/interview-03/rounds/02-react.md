# GitJira: React component and interaction interview

Work one case at a time in approximately 35 minutes. These are six distinct scenarios viewed through this interview round. Select a case you have not recently rehearsed. The [source map](../README.md), [scorecard](../SCORECARD.md), and [project defense](../PROJECT-DEFENSE.md) support your attempt. Afterward use the [separate interviewer notes](../_interviewer/rounds/02-react.md).

## How to run this round

Sketch a small React view for this case using the project's existing component style. Start with state ownership: which values are server observations, local drafts, selection, request status, or derived display values? Draw the parent/child boundary and identify the user event that starts the operation. Do not import server-only domain code into the browser to reuse a convenient function.

Write a state table before JSX. Include initial, pending, success with data, empty success, failure, and stale/conflict behavior where relevant. Explain which states cannot occur together and how the component prevents an impossible combination. Keep changes tied to an explicit user event separate from synchronization with an external subscription or resource.

The interviewer will change the selected entity or unmount the view while work is pending. Show what happens to an old response and to any event listener or subscription. Explain the identity of list keys and controlled form values. Add a keyboard-only route through the primary action and describe where an error message should be discoverable.

Deliver a component outline, a transition table, and a user-level test plan. If you did not run a browser, label the focus, timing, and accessibility observations as proposed rather than verified.

## 04.2.1 — Omitted and cleared fields collapse

**Scenario.** An issue patch should preserve an omitted assignee but clear an explicitly null assignee. A truthiness shortcut also loses a legitimate zero estimate.

**Starting fixture.** Old assignee=U1, points=3; patch {assigneeId:null,points:0}.

Your user is a project contributor; the affected surface is the issue board and detail editor. Keep workspace/project and authenticated session visible in the model. The user-facing operation is to update an issue and refresh its views.

### Project-specific follow-through

Start at the [project source map](../README.md), then trace shared schemas, API session handling, and cache/query ownership. Locate one current symbol that supports your explanation and one assumption the fixture adds. If the application already handles the scenario, characterize that behavior instead of inventing a fix. Record the repository state you inspected so later changes do not silently invalidate your answer.

Before opening the interviewer notes, write a result for the supplied fixture and one counterexample of your own. Ask the interviewer to vary exactly one fact, then explain what changes and what stays invariant. Finish with one sentence naming the evidence that would be needed to move from this practice answer to an application claim.

**Evidence to keep:** your first prediction, the artifact requested in this round, the strongest follow-up question, your revised explanation, and any check that remains unrun. Repeating the same answer faster is not the goal; surviving a changed input is.

## 04.2.2 — One refresh request serves several callers

**Scenario.** Two requests encounter an expired session at nearly the same time. A shared refresh is meant to prevent duplicate refresh work.

**Starting fixture.** CallerA and B wait on refresh R; R rejects; callerC retries later.

Your user is a project contributor; the affected surface is the issue board and detail editor. Keep workspace/project and authenticated session visible in the model. The user-facing operation is to update an issue and refresh its views.

## 04.2.3 — Logout occurs during refresh

**Scenario.** A refresh starts, the user logs out, and an old refresh response later returns. A successful response must not silently resurrect the earlier session.

**Starting fixture.** Session generation7 starts R; logout advances8; R for7 resolves.

Your user is a project contributor; the affected surface is the issue board and detail editor. Keep workspace/project and authenticated session visible in the model. The user-facing operation is to update an issue and refresh its views.

## 04.2.4 — Board and detail disagree after a save

**Scenario.** The detail view displays a new issue status while the board remains stale. A candidate must identify which data sets contain the changed entity.

**Starting fixture.** Issue I1 moves open to done; detail refreshed; board=open filter unchanged.

Your user is a project contributor; the affected surface is the issue board and detail editor. Keep workspace/project and authenticated session visible in the model. The user-facing operation is to update an issue and refresh its views.

## 04.2.5 — Dependencies contain a cycle

**Scenario.** A synthetic issue planner orders prerequisites before dependents. A cycle should be reported rather than returning an incomplete plan as success.

**Starting fixture.** I1 depends on I2; I2 depends on I1; I3 independent.

Your user is a project contributor; the affected surface is the issue board and detail editor. Keep workspace/project and authenticated session visible in the model. The user-facing operation is to update an issue and refresh its views.

## 04.2.6 — A stale closure saves an old title

**Scenario.** An editor schedules work that captures the title at the time of an event. The user changes the title before the work finishes. Clarify whether the operation belongs to the original submission or the current draft.

**Starting fixture.** Submitted title=A; draft becomes B; scheduled save uses A.
