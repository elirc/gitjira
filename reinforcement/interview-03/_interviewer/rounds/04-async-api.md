# Interviewer notes: GitJira / Asynchronous JavaScript and API boundaries

Keep this file closed during a first attempt. Accept behaviorally correct alternatives that satisfy the declared contract. Source-grounded explanations and honest limitations matter more than matching these words. Return to the [candidate round](../../rounds/04-async-api.md) to run a new attempt.

## How to evaluate this round

A good answer distinguishes scheduling, response arrival, and authoritative completion. It does not infer that a timeout rolled back the server or that aborting a browser request erased an accepted operation. The candidate chooses an identity that matches the intended sharing or retry boundary, then checks that identity when applying results.

For shared in-flight work, ask what remains after failure. A cleanup path must not strand later callers behind a settled rejected promise unless retaining failures is an explicit caching policy. For retries, ask which failures are eligible, how attempts are bounded, and whether repeating a mutation could duplicate an effect. Read retry policy and mutation idempotency are separate contracts.

Use a controlled schedule: launch A, launch B, resolve B, then resolve A. Require assertions about the accepted result and rejected stale work, not merely that both promises settled. Add the scope-switch or lost-response variation from the candidate's explanation. No arbitrary sleep is needed when the race is caused by an order the test can choose.

If the proposed answer needs an atomic database write, unique operation receipt, or authenticated event, make the candidate name that dependency rather than bury it inside a generic request helper. Junior success is a sound local timeline with a clearly identified external guarantee. Claims such as exactly once, safe retry, or cancellation must be narrowed to what the code and evidence actually establish.

## 04.4.1 — Omitted and cleared fields collapse

### Expected project reasoning

**Invariant:** Omitted, null, and zero are distinct contract cases.

Clear the assignee and set points to zero; preserve fields absent from the patch. Check own-property presence rather than truthiness. Compare the teaching fixture with the actual shared update schema.

**Plausible wrong approach:** Use value || oldValue for every field.

Use the exact starting fixture from [the candidate round](../../rounds/04-async-api.md). Require the candidate to predict its outcome before discussing an abstract pattern. If they propose a different product policy, ask them to state it explicitly and show how the acceptance examples change; do not confuse a policy disagreement with a JavaScript error.

### Follow-up and calibration

Ask which responsibility belongs to shared schemas, API session handling, and cache/query ownership and which belongs to the issue board and detail editor. Then remove one assumption the candidate relied on: validated input, stable identity, one caller, one process, or unchanged scope. Require an updated example, not a new collection of buzzwords.

Award 0 for an unsupported or incorrect answer, 1 for a correct explanation without a discriminating example, and 2 for a correct mechanism plus a counterexample and an appropriately scoped observation. Record separate scores for mechanism, contract, verification, and communication. Do not score an unrun browser or database check as observed evidence. The notes provide a reasoning direction, not a memorization script or a substitute for inspecting the repository.

## 04.4.2 — One refresh request serves several callers

### Expected project reasoning

**Invariant:** In-flight sharing must settle every waiter and release its state on failure.

Use one pending operation for the relevant session identity, propagate its outcome, and clear the gate in both success and failure paths. A rejected promise retained forever prevents a later legitimate attempt.

**Plausible wrong approach:** Reset the shared promise only in the success branch.

Use the exact starting fixture from [the candidate round](../../rounds/04-async-api.md). Require the candidate to predict its outcome before discussing an abstract pattern. If they propose a different product policy, ask them to state it explicitly and show how the acceptance examples change; do not confuse a policy disagreement with a JavaScript error.

Award 0 for an unsupported or incorrect answer, 1 for a correct explanation without a discriminating example, and 2 for a correct mechanism plus a counterexample and an appropriately scoped observation. Record separate scores for mechanism, contract, verification, and communication. Do not score an unrun browser or database check as observed evidence. The notes provide a reasoning direction, not a memorization script or a substitute for inspecting the repository.

## 04.4.3 — Logout occurs during refresh

### Expected project reasoning

**Invariant:** A response must still belong to the active session generation when applied.

Ignore obsolete session results and keep logout authoritative. This is a separate concern from reducing duplicate refresh calls; demonstrate the timeline before proposing a combined helper.

**Plausible wrong approach:** Treat every successful refresh response as permission to save a token.

Use the exact starting fixture from [the candidate round](../../rounds/04-async-api.md). Require the candidate to predict its outcome before discussing an abstract pattern. If they propose a different product policy, ask them to state it explicitly and show how the acceptance examples change; do not confuse a policy disagreement with a JavaScript error.

## 04.4.4 — Board and detail disagree after a save

### Expected project reasoning

**Invariant:** Every affected cached projection needs an explicit update or invalidation policy.

Trace the query keys and mutation ownership. Verify the previous filtered list loses I1 and the target list gains it when appropriate. A single broad invalidate may work but needs a scope and cost explanation.

**Plausible wrong approach:** Refresh only the currently visible detail query.

Use the exact starting fixture from [the candidate round](../../rounds/04-async-api.md). Require the candidate to predict its outcome before discussing an abstract pattern. If they propose a different product policy, ask them to state it explicitly and show how the acceptance examples change; do not confuse a policy disagreement with a JavaScript error.

## 04.4.5 — Dependencies contain a cycle

### Expected project reasoning

**Invariant:** A successful plan must include every issue once and respect every prerequisite.

Use a graph algorithm with cycle detection; report the unresolved cycle condition rather than silently returning I3 as a complete plan. Distinguish missing dependency IDs from cycles.

**Plausible wrong approach:** Stop when no node is available and label the partial output successful.

Use the exact starting fixture from [the candidate round](../../rounds/04-async-api.md). Require the candidate to predict its outcome before discussing an abstract pattern. If they propose a different product policy, ask them to state it explicitly and show how the acceptance examples change; do not confuse a policy disagreement with a JavaScript error.

## 04.4.6 — A stale closure saves an old title

### Expected project reasoning

**Invariant:** Captured submission data and current draft data have different ownership.

For a submission snapshot, A may be correct; for an autosave of the latest draft it may be wrong. State the product rule before choosing a ref, effect, or cancellation strategy.

**Plausible wrong approach:** Always read the latest value, even when confirming an earlier explicit submission.

Use the exact starting fixture from [the candidate round](../../rounds/04-async-api.md). Require the candidate to predict its outcome before discussing an abstract pattern. If they propose a different product policy, ask them to state it explicitly and show how the acceptance examples change; do not confuse a policy disagreement with a JavaScript error.
